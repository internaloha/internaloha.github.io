This release should be mostly backward compatible with existing Morea instructor content, though there are extensive changes (and simplifications!) to the way sites are developed and managed.\\n\\n## Summary of changes\\n\\nHere is a summary of the changes from Version 2:\\n\\n  1. Morea 3 uses the latest releases of Jekyll (Version 4.2.0), Bootstrap (5), Bootswatch (5), FullCalendar (5.8), and ChartJS (3.5).\\n\\n  2. Create a new Morea 3 site using the GitHub \\"template\\" mechanism.  Templates have advantages over the previous approach of cloning: you can create a private repository even though the template is a public repository, and you can create multiple repositories in a single organization from the same template.\\n\\n  3. Morea 3 sites are automatically built and deployed via GitHub Actions whenever there is a commit to the main branch. Unlike Morea 2, Morea 3 does not use custom scripts (such as `morea-run-local.sh`, `morea-publish.sh`, etc.).\\n\\n  4. Morea 3 does not require local management of multiple branches.  Unlike Morea 2, there are no \\"src\\" and \\"gh-pages\\" subdirectories.\\n\\n  5. To build and run a Morea 3 site locally, you no longer use a custom script (`morea-run-local.sh`). Instead, you use the standard Jekyll command `bundle exec jekyll serve`.\\n\\n  6. To publish a Morea 3 site, you no longer use a special script (`morea-publish.sh`). Instead, you just commit your changes and push your repository to GitHub. Morea 3 uses GitHub Actions to automatically build and publish the site whenever there is a commit to the main branch in GitHub.\\n\\n  5. Morea 3 is (finally!) cross-platform: there should be no significant differences between development on MacOS, Linux, and Windows platforms.\\n\\nAstute Morea users will also observe that https://morea-framework.github.io has been reimplemented using Docusaurus.  This will make documentation easier to maintain.\\n\\n## Migrating your V2 content to V3\\n\\nInstructors who have existing Morea V2 sites for a course taught in a prior semester and who wish to build a new Morea site for a future semester will need to migrate their content.  Here are the issues that have been discovered with this migration:\\n\\nIn Morea 3, Assessments are no longer \\"page fragments\\" (like Outcomes), but rather their own page. This leads to several breaking changes:\\n\\n* The morea_summary field is now required for Assessment pages.\\n* The URL for interior linking to an Assessment page has changed. Please see [this page](/docs/instructors/linking-in-morea).\\n\\nMorea 3 updates JSChart from Version 1 to Version 3. As a result:\\n\\n* Pages that embed JSChart graphs must be updated to the JSChart 3 API. For example, see the [example Morea assessment page](https://morea-framework.github.io/morea/morea/example-javascript/assessment-javascript-1.html).\\n\\nMorea 3 updates Bootstrap from Version 3 to Version 5. As a result:\\n\\n* Pages that embed Bootstrap CSS and HTML must be updated to Bootstrap Version 5.\\n\\n\\n## Getting started\\n\\nIf you are a current user of Morea, please read the Getting Started section of the Instructor Guide and try building a new site using your old Morea files.  If you run into problems, please create an issue or send an email so we can address it.\\n\\nA list of known issues and desired enhancements for Morea 3 is available at [https://github.com/morea-framework/morea/issues](https://github.com/morea-framework/morea/issues)."},{"id":"Fix font loading over https","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2016/08/09/font-fix","source":"@site/blog/2016-08-09-font-fix.md","title":"Fix font loading over https","description":"Unfortunately, several of the Morea \\"cerulean\\" style themes (i.e. cerulean\\\\green, cerulean\\\\red, etc.) were loading the Open Sans font using the http by default, sites built using those themes were not displaying the Open Sans font correctly when retrieved from a github.io domain.

Inspect your current master/src/\\\\_layouts/default.html.  Do you add any navbar items (or anything else) to that file? If so, copy the added lines to a text buffer someplace and remember where they were located in your default.html file.  If you didn\'t add anything, great.\\n\\n  2. Invoke `morea-merge-upstream.sh`.  You will get a merge conflict in default.html. Don\'t panic.\\n\\n  3. Edit your `master/src/_layouts/default.html` file.   Make it identical to this [default.html](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/morea-framework/core/master/src/_layouts/default.html) file.\\n\\n  4. If you had added navbar links or something to your original default.html file,  then edit the `master/src/_layouts/core.html` file to put them back in.  This will look almost exactly like your old default.html file. Add back in whatever customizations you saved to your text buffer in Step 1.\\n\\n  5. There is a slight chance your `master/_config.html` file also has a merge conflict. If so, just edit it back to your original version. (the changes are just the addition of comments.)\\n\\nThat\'s it. Now invoke `morea-run-local.sh` and see if everything looks OK. If not, fix it. If you can\'t fix it, send me an email.\\n\\nNow invoke `morea-publish.sh` to publish your cool new breadcrumbs to the world!"},{"id":"morea-watch.rb","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2015/10/10/morea-watch","source":"@site/blog/2015-10-10-morea-watch.md","title":"morea-watch.rb","description":"The Morea team is delighted to announce the release of morea-watch.rb, a ruby script you can use instead of morea-run-local.sh and which will automatically stop and restart morea-run-local.sh whenever files in the morea directory change.","date":"2015-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 10, 2015","tags":[],"readingTime":0.26,"truncated":false,"authors":[],"prevItem":{"title":"Breadcrumbs!","permalink":"/blog/2015/10/23/breadcrumbs"},"nextItem":{"title":"Morea Lintui","permalink":"/blog/2015/09/22/morea-lintui"}},"content":"The Morea team is delighted to announce the release of morea-watch.rb, a ruby script you can use instead of morea-run-local.sh and which will automatically stop and restart morea-run-local.sh whenever files in the morea directory change.\\n\\nMorea-watch.rb was developed by Dan Port.
