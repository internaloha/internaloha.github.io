title: Motivation for Morea
---

The fundamental goal of the Morea Framework is to provide technology infrastructure that enables new forms of curriculum design that goes beyond traditional, monolithic, semester-based approaches. Morea enables instructional design at the time-frame of weeks, not months, and breaks down technical barriers to interdisciplinary content creation and collaboration. It also addresses chronic problems with traditional learning management systems regarding content management.
